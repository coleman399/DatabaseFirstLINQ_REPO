Database First LINQ Problems

Technologies: SQL, C# LINQ, Entity Framework, Pair Programming

Project points (unweighted): /100 (5 points per problem)

Project points (weighted): /40

Setup

• Create GitHub repository and add any collaborators to the repository. 

• Watch setup video to set up your SQL database in the MSSQL Local Database in Visual Studio. 

• Using the provided SQL queries, create tables and insert data into those created tables in your 
database.

• Begin working on the LINQ problems with your paired developer.

• Commit your code after each problem is solved (minimum of 20 commits)

IMPORTANT: you are required to pair program while in a video call (Zoom or Slack video) with your 
paired developer on this project. 

• Pair programming is a practice in agile software development where two developers work 
together on a problem/project/feature. It typically involves one computer. One developer (the 
driver) writes the code while the other (the observer) provides guidance and direction for the 
driver. The observer will watch, review, and research to provide assistance for the driver. The 
two developers switch roles frequently. 

• This requires you and your paired developer to share screen in Zoom or Slack video. 

• We recommend switching roles for each problem you work on.
